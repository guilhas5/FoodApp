# FoodApp

## Introduction

#### This is a simple food app that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients or recipe names. 
It was developed as my first React project, where I had the opportunity to learn and apply React concepts and build a functional application from scratch.

The app provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily find recipes that match their preferences. 
Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or simply looking for new recipe ideas, this app has you covered. It leverages the power of React to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

I built this app as a personal project to solidify my understanding of React and showcase my ability to develop a functional application independently. 
I hope you find it useful and enjoy exploring various recipes with ease!
